      "introduction": "Hi there! I'm **Jiashu Liu**, currently pursuing my master's degree at the **University of Helsinki** in Finland. I have a deep passion for software development and how technology can enhance everyday life. <br /><br />My primary programming languages are **Python** and **JavaScript/TypeScript**, also use **Java** when needed. My work experience has given me a strong interest in **cloud platforms** and the **XaaS (Everything as a Service) ecosystem**. I always strive to stay up to date with emerging technologies—lately, I’ve been exploring ways to seamlessly integrate **LLMs** into daily life.<br /><br />Beyond coding, I love exploring beauty in all forms. I enjoy **handicrafts 🛠️**, **interior design 🏠**, **light art 💡**, and **photography 📷**. Creativity 🎨 fuels me just as much as technology does!😊"
